# FlixBus GTFS Mobility Data Project Plan

---

## Major Goals

1. **Understand and Prepare the Data**  
   Get familiar with the structure, quality, and relationships in the dataset.

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Discover key insights about routes, trips, stops, service patterns, and usage.

3. **Analyze Network and Operational Efficiency**  
   Identify bottlenecks, optimize routes, and understand transfer behavior.

4. **Visualize the Data for Insights**  
   Create maps and charts to communicate findings effectively.

5. **(Optional) Build Predictive Models**  
   Forecast delays, demand, or improve operational planning.

6. **Document and Report Findings**  
   Summarize insights and recommend actionable improvements.

## Tasks to Accomplish

### Goal 1: Understand and Prepare the Data
- Load all text files (`routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `stops.txt`, etc.)  
- Inspect data shapes, types, and missing values  
- Understand relationships between tables via key columns (e.g., `route_id`, `trip_id`, `stop_id`)  
- Clean and preprocess data:  
  - Handle missing or invalid entries  
  - Convert times to proper datetime or timedelta formats  
  - Normalize categorical variables if needed  
  - Index columns for faster joins and queries

### Goal 2: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics: total routes, stops, trips, transfers, service days  
- Distribution of trip durations, number of stops per trip  
- Frequency analysis of trips per route and by day of week  
- Identify busiest stops and busiest transfer points  
- Temporal patterns: peak hours, weekend vs weekday service  
- Coverage analysis: geographic distribution of stops and routes

### Goal 3: Analyze Network and Operational Efficiency
- Merge relevant tables to create enriched datasets (e.g., trips + routes + stops)  
- Calculate average trip durations and stop dwell times  
- Analyze transfer times and feasibility of connections  
- Build a graph/network representation of stops and routes  
- Identify critical nodes/hubs and bottlenecks in the network  
- Detect under-served or isolated areas by mapping service frequency

### Goal 4: Visualize the Data for Insights
- Plot routes and stops on interactive maps (Folium, Plotly, geopandas)  
- Time series plots showing service frequency and delays over time  
- Heatmaps for stop usage and transfer volumes  
- Dashboard creation for monitoring key KPIs and metrics (Streamlit/Dash)

### Goal 5 (Optional): Build Predictive Models
- Model trip delays based on historical trip data and timing patterns  
- Forecast route demand using temporal and historical data  
- Cluster stops or routes by usage patterns for operational grouping

### Goal 6: Document and Report Findings
- Write a comprehensive report summarizing key insights  
- Suggest actionable recommendations for route optimization and scheduling improvements  
- Prepare presentation slides or dashboards for stakeholders
